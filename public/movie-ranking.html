<p>"Gods of Egypt" is a visually striking fantasy film set in an ancient Egypt filled with gods and mortals. The story follows mortal hero Bek as he teams up with the god Horus to overthrow the tyrannical god Set. The film's impressive visual effects and imaginative world-building stand out, but its storytelling is uneven, with convoluted plot elements and pacing issues. Controversies over casting choices also impact the film's cultural authenticity. Despite these drawbacks, the movie offers captivating action scenes and a unique blend of mythology and fantasy that might appeal to fans of the genre.</p>
<h3>Geostorm</h3>

<p>"Geostorm" is a visually impressive disaster movie set in a future where weather-controlling satellites malfunction, causing extreme weather events. While the film's stunning visual effects showcase catastrophic weather phenomena, its formulaic plot, shallow characters, and occasional reliance on convenient plot devices hinder its potential impact. Gerard Butler's performance as the lead lacks depth, and the dialogue often falls into clich√©s. Despite these shortcomings, the movie remains entertaining due to its intense action sequences and spectacular CGI. It's a popcorn flick best enjoyed for its surface-level excitement rather than its depth or originality.</p>
