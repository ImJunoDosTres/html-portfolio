<p>Hello there! Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm Angelo M. Tiquio, a 30-year-old dreamer, educator, and aspiring web developer. Originally from the beautiful Philippines, I've now planted my roots in the diverse and vibrant landscape of Canada. Join me as I take you through the chapters of my life, from a dedicated Professional Licensed Teacher to someone determined to make a mark in the world of IT.</p>

<h2>A Passion for Education:</h2>

For the past 9 years, I've had the privilege of standing in front of eager minds, shaping their futures as a dedicated teacher. I have always been passionate about education, believing in its transformative power. There's something truly magical about watching a student's eyes light up when they grasp a new concept, conquer a challenging problem, or simply feel seen and valued in the classroom. Teaching isn't just a profession for me; it's a calling that's imprinted in the core of my being.

<h2>A New Direction Beckons:</h2>

While teaching has been immensely rewarding, life is a journey that unfolds in unexpected ways. As much as I adore the classroom, there's a new path calling my name - the world of web development. The IT industry has always fascinated me with its endless possibilities for innovation, problem-solving, and creativity. The idea of crafting digital experiences that can impact lives on a global scale has ignited a fire within me.

<h2>The Dream to Reality:</h2>

Transitioning from teaching to web development might seem like a leap, but it's a leap I'm excited to take. Armed with determination, a curious mind, and an insatiable appetite for learning, I'm embarking on a journey to turn my dream into reality. From coding languages to responsive design, from user experience to creating captivating interfaces - I'm ready to soak up knowledge and skills like a sponge.

<h2>Challenges and Triumphs:</h2>

Undoubtedly, this journey won't be without its challenges. Learning an entirely new skill set takes time, effort, and dedication. Yet, it's the challenges that make victory all the more sweet. I'm prepared to face setbacks and embrace failures as stepping stones toward success. With my teaching background, I understand the value of patience and perseverance. After all, every line of code written is a lesson learned, and every project tackled is an opportunity for growth.

<h2>What Lies Ahead:</h2>

As I write this blog, I'm at the crossroads of change. I'm not leaving my love for education behind; rather, I'm evolving it. I'm excited to blend my teaching instincts with my newfound passion for web development. Through this blog, I hope to share my experiences, challenges, and triumphs as I navigate this transformation. I'm eager to connect with fellow dreamers, educators, and tech enthusiasts who believe in the power of chasing dreams and embracing change.
